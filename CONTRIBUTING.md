There are 3 algorithms to be implemented in this project as given in the research papers, you should name your file such as to signify what algorithm you are dealing with.

The frontend.py deals with the data acquisition task. In this, we have 3 points to extract
1) The Location of Residential Customer (Latitute and Longitute matrix)
2) The Possible transformer locations, i.e. street points of osm (Latitute and Longitute matrix)
3) Possible connections between the transformers. (Adjacency Matrix)

Now, after data acquisition, we will move to algorithm 1, which will deal with MV line routing, for this, we will choose optimal trasformer location out of the possible locations (street points) using K-Mediods, then we will route it using Modified Prim.
